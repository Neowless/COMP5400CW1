The simulation results are exported in the [`Question1/Mice.pop`](https://github.com/Neowless/COMP5400CW1/blob/main/Question1/Mice.pop), the data is extracted in [`Question1/question_1.mat`](https://github.com/Neowless/COMP5400CW1/blob/main/Question1/question_1.mat), the plots are generated by MATLAB 2021b, the scripts for generating the plots is [`Question1/Question1.m`](https://github.com/Neowless/COMP5400CW1/blob/main/Question1/Question1.m).

### Reasons Why Choosing This Range

The simulation was terminated after 3,000 generations to obtain enough data. [Figure 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Neowless/COMP5400CW1/e1373e0b9de5c8d6b2b86aaf0ce66d0b625631d2/Question1/0-3000.svg) shows the whole range of the data.

* For the generation count range. In the generation domain from 0 to 150, the values of average fitness are highly irregular. In the range of 150-400, the average fitness numbers increase non-linearly. After 400 generations, the average fitness of the mice becomes stable around 0.008. The best fitness value also has similar characteristics. The generation range for both fitness are **0-400**
* For the fitness range. Considering the noise level and representive generation range. 

## Question 2

The mice evolves fatser, smarter and more efficient seeking the cheese over evolutionary time. The specific behaviours in explained in [Table 1]()

| Generation Count | Behaviour | 
| ---  | --- |
| 0    | The mice move randomly and slowly, most of them are circling, only a few of the mice are moving at a relative faster speed in a relative straight line. The mice rarely obtain the cheese.| 
|   300   | The mice increase the speed. A few of mice’s movement show regular rules aiming at the cheese. However, the whole specie’s behaviours are irregular. After finishing one cheese, the mice just keep the previous direction. Some of the mice obtain the cheese. | 
|    500   | The behaviour does not change a lot, but the moving speed of the mice increase a little. Some of the mice are competing for one cheese.|
| 1000 | All of the mice are moving at a relative high speed, the mice are divided into many groups, each group usually competing for one cheese, after finishing one cheese, the mice are really sensitive to the nearest cheese and change its direction to obtain another cheese. | 
| 4000 | The mice started to rotate on the spot to evaluate the distances of the cheese around it which is a more efficient way to decide the behaviour. |

This repository is where you will develop a driver for the Seven Segment Display peripherals on the DE1-SoC.

Please refer to the assignment specification on Minerva for more details.

The following files are provided:
 
| File | Purpose |
| ---  | --- |
| `1-A-SevenSegDisplay/.project`      | Skeleton DS-5 project definition |
| `1-A-SevenSegDisplay/.cproject`     | As above |
| `1-A-SevenSegDisplay/main.c`        | A test program which will allow you to test your solution (**do not modify**). |
| `1-A-SevenSegDisplay/DE1SoC_SevenSeg/DE1SoC_SevenSeg.h` | The header file which defines the interface for the driver (**do not modify**). |
| `1-A-SevenSegDisplay/DE1SoC_SevenSeg/DE1SoC_SevenSeg.c` | The implementation file for the driver. You need to complete this file. |

Please note the project will need configuring in DS-5 before it will compile.

## Driver Functions 

| Function Name  | Introduction
| ---  | --- |
| DE1SoC_SevenSeg_Write         | Low level set function to send a byte value to a selected display.             |
| DE1SoC_SevenSeg_SetSingle     | Set a single seven segment display from a hexadecimal (0x0-0xF) value.    |
| DE1SoC_SevenSeg_SetDoubleHex  | Set a pair of seven segment displays from a hexadecimal (0x00-0xFF) value.  |
| DE1SoC_SevenSeg_SetDoubleDec  | Set a pair of seven segment displays from a decimal (00-99) value.          |

### Required Layouts for the Hexadecimal Numbers 0-F

### Anode or Cathode?
The 7-Segment displays on the DE-Soc share their **anode**.

If the type of the displays have been changed in to cathode version, just replace the mapping table with the commented one in  `DE1SoC_SevenSeg_SetSingle` function in the [`1-A-SevenSegDisplay/DE1SoC_SevenSeg/DE1SoC_SevenSeg.c`](https://github.com/leeds-embedded-systems/ELEC5620M-Assignment1-Neowless/blob/main/1-A-SevenSegDisplay/DE1SoC_SevenSeg/DE1SoC_SevenSeg.c).



```
void DE1SoC_SevenSeg_SetSingle(unsigned int display, unsigned int value) {
    // ToDo: Write the code for driving a single seven segment display here.
    // Your function should turn a real value 0-F into the correctly encoded
    // bits to enable the correct segments on the seven segment display to
    // illuminate. Use the DE1SoC_SevenSeg_Write function you created earlier
    // to set the bits of the display.

	// Mapping_Table array defines the layout of the 7-Segment displays
	//including 0-9 and A-F, which is a mapping or translation between the
	//hex or decimal input and the actual output bit connected to the 7 segment
	//displays.
	
	// Table for 7 segment displays with common Anode.
	char Mapping_Table[]={0x3f,0x06,0x5b,0x4f,0x66,0x6d,0x7d,0x07,0x7f,0x6f,0x77,0x7c,0x39,0x5e,0x79,0x71};
	// Table for 7 segment display with common Cathode.
	//char table[]={0xc0,0xf9,0xa4,0xb0,0x99,0x92,0x82,0xf8,0x80,0x90,0x88,0x83,0xc6,0xa1,0x86,0x8e};

	//Call the lower function to display the value.
	DE1SoC_SevenSeg_Write(display, Mapping_Table[value]);
}
