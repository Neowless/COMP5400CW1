The simulation results are exported in the [`Question1/Mice.pop`](https://github.com/Neowless/COMP5400CW1/blob/main/Question1/Mice.pop), the data is extracted in [`Question1/question_1.mat`](https://github.com/Neowless/COMP5400CW1/blob/main/Question1/question_1.mat), the plots are generated by MATLAB 2021b, the scripts for generating the plots is [`Question1/Question1.m`](https://github.com/Neowless/COMP5400CW1/blob/main/Question1/Question1.m).

### Reasons Why Choosing This Range

The simulation was terminated after 3,000 generations to obtain enough data. [Figure 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Neowless/COMP5400CW1/e1373e0b9de5c8d6b2b86aaf0ce66d0b625631d2/Question1/0-3000.svg) shows the whole range of the data.

* For the generation count range. In the generation domain from 0 to 150, the values of average fitness are highly irregular. In the range of 150-400, the average fitness numbers increase non-linearly. After 400 generations, the average fitness of the mice becomes stable around 0.008. The best fitness value also has similar characteristics. The generation range for both fitness are **0-400**
* For the fitness range. Considering the noise level and representive generation range. 

## Question 2

The mice evolves fatser, smarter and more efficient seeking the cheese over evolutionary time. The specific behaviours in explained in [Table 1]()

| Generation Count | Behaviour | 
| ---  | --- |
| 0    | The mice move randomly and slowly, most of them are circling, only a few of the mice are moving at a relative faster speed in a relative straight line. The mice rarely obtain the cheese.| 
|   300   | The mice increase the speed. A few of mice’s movement show regular rules aiming at the cheese. However, the whole specie’s behaviours are irregular. After finishing one cheese, the mice just keep the previous direction. Some of the mice obtain the cheese. | 
|    500   | The behaviour does not change a lot, but the moving speed of the mice increase a little. Some of the mice are competing for one cheese.|
| 1000 | All of the mice are moving at a relative high speed, the mice are divided into many groups, each group usually competing for one cheese, after finishing one cheese, the mice are really sensitive to the nearest cheese and change its direction to obtain another cheese. | 
| 4000 | The mice started to rotate on the spot to evaluate the distances of the cheese around it which is a more efficient way to decide the behaviour. |

## Question 3

### Discrition of the Fitness Function Used by the Mice

The fitness used by the Mice is in [`Question1/mouse.cc`](https://github.com/Neowless/COMP5400CW1/blob/main/Question1/mouse.cc) line 136-143.

``` C++
	// The EvoMouse's fitness is the amount of cheese collected, divided by
	// the power usage, so a mouse is penalised for simply charging around
	// as fast as possible and randomly collecting cheese - it needs to find
	// its target carefully.
	virtual float GetFitness()const
	{
		return This.cheesesFound > 0 ? static_cast<float>(This.cheesesFound) / This.DistanceTravelled.as<float>() : 0;
	}
}
```
The fitness of each mouse is obtained this `GetFitness()` function. There are two vairables in this function, `This.cheesesFound` indicates the cheeses found by the mouse in this generation simulation, and `This.DistanceTravelled.as` represents the distance the mouse travled in this generation.

If the mouse found the cheese, its fitness value equals to the amount of the cheese divided by the distance it travled, or the fitness value equals to 0.

$$ \left\{\begin{array}{l} \textup{Fitness} = \frac{\textup{Cheese Found}}{\textup{Distance Travlled}}(\textup{Cheese Found}>0)) 
\\ \textup{Fitness} = 0(\textup{Cheese Found}=0)) 
\end{array}\right. $$
<div align=center><text>Equation 1. Mice Fitness Function</text></div>


In order to train the mice forming a efficient way to find the cheese, the distance travled by the mouse determins the power consumption influencing the fitness value.
